    just like that?</i>
    
    2
    00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,445
    <i>Just like that.</i>
    
    3
    00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,796
    <i>I wouldn't go in there
    for a day or two.</i>
    
    4
    00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:36,647
    <i>Heard the expression
    kick the hornet's nest?</i>

    here. Thank you.</i>

    <i>They been killing my honey bees.</i>

    <i>A few days unchecked,</i>
    
    9
    00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:46,261
    <i>they'll wipe out
    the whole colony.</i>
    
    10
    00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:47,722
    <i>What are you gonna do with them?</i>
    
    11
    00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,158
    <i>Well, that's
    between me and them,</i>
    
    12
    00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,204
    <i>if you don't mind.</i>
    
    13
    00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:52,423
    <i>That's okay.</i>
    
    14
    00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,686
    <i>I understand these things.</i>
    
    15
    00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,908
    <i>I just wanted to thank you</i>
    
    16

    17
    00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:05,164
    <i>and all of my bees.</i>
    
    18
    00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,829
    <i>This place was
    crabgrass and weeds,</i>
    
    19
    00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,110
    <i>and you brought it back to life.</i>
    
    20
    00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,536
    <i>You're a blessing.</i>
    
    21
    00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,067
    <i>No one's ever taken
    care of me before.</i>
    
    22
    00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:21,800

    - I got one.</i>
    
    27
    00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,838
    <i>I want it. I need it.</i>
    
    28
    00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,318
    <i>Hey, put it in my ear.</i>
    
    29

    <i>Uh, hello. I just
    got a message saying</i>
    
    34
    00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,158
    <i>that there's a problem
    with my computer.</i>
    
    35
    00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,942
    <i>Don't you worry. The
    message you received</i>
    
    36
    00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,162
    <i>is from our United Data
    Group antivirus software.</i>
    
    37
    00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,528
    <i>It's part of the
    software package</i>
    
    38
    00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,140
    <i>that you pre-installed
    on your computer.</i>
    
    39
    00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,515
    <i>I'm sorry. I'm not
    a computer person.</i>
    
    40
    00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:10,518
    <i>What did you say the name
    of your product is again?</i>
    
    41
    00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:19,961
    <i>Now, our records show
    that you actually</i>
    
    42
    00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,832
    <i>have an older version
    on your account.</i>
    
    43
    00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,444
    <i>So what I'm going to need
    you to do is uninstall that</i>
    
    44
    00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,228
    <i>and install the latest version.</i>
    
    45
    00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,143
    <i>Well, I have no
    idea how to do that.</i>
    
    46
    00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:29,710
    <i>My daughter set up
    everything for me.</i>
    
    47
    00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:31,180
    <i>Well, I would recommend</i>
    
    48
    00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,645
    <i>you take your computer
    to an IT specialist.</i>
    
    49
    00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,236
    <i>However, keep in mind</i>
    
    50
    00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:36,238
    <i>that you will lose
    all your data,</i>
    
    51
    00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,653
    <i>since they'll have to
    replace the hard drive.</i>
    
    52
    00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:41,591
    <i>I'm pretty remote out here.</i>
    
    53
    00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,291
    <i>Everything I have
    is on the computer.</i>
    
    54
    00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,685
    <i>Okay. There is actually</i>
    
    55
    00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,642
    <i>a software package
    that you can download</i>
    
    56
    00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,948
    <i>that would allow me
    to reinstall remotely.</i>
    
    57
    00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,406
    <i>All right. Tell me what to do.</i>
    
    58
    00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:56,838
    <i>It's okay. Can you,
    uh, can you type this,</i>
    
    59
    00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,908
    <i>Friendly friend dot net?</i>
    
    60
    00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,021
    <i>Spelled just how it sounds.</i>
    
    61
    00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,832
    <i>Okay. I'm there.</i>
    
    62
    00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,268
    <i>And there should be a button</i>
    
    63
    00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:07,356
    <i>on your screen that
    says "install."</i>
    
    64
    00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:08,705
    <i>Can you click on that button?</i>
    
    65
    00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:09,911
    <i>I clicked the button.</i>
    
    66
    00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:11,685
    <i>So you're about to
    see some windows</i>
    
    67
    00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,319

    68
    00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,408

    virus shield for you.</i>
    
    69
    00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,310
    <i>Okay.</i>
    
    70
    00:07:18,335 --> 00:07:20,543
    <i>I hope you fucking clowns
    are paying attention.</i>
    
    71
    00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,217
    <i>You stick to the script,</i>
    
    72
    00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,419
    <i>but not so much that you
    sound like a goddamn robot.</i>
    
    73
    00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,637
    <i>All right?</i>
    
    74

    78
    00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,953
    <i>All right.</i>

    <i>She is a signatory</i>

    some fucking charity.</i>
    
    82
    00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,660
    <i>All right, kids, let
    the strip mining begin.</i>
    
    83
    00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,447
    <i>Ooh. My computer's
    going crazy.</i>
    
    84
    00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:55,216
    <i>Totally normal.</i>
    
    85
    00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,599
    <i>Just do not touch your keyboard.</i>

    <i>I'm going to credit back
    your subscription fees.</i>
    
    88
    00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:08,983
    <i>How about that?</i>
    
    89
    00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:10,989
    <i>I've gone ahead

    <i>Just hold on.</i>
    
    96
    00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,088
    <i>Yes, there's...</i>
    
    97

    101
    00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:40,669
    <i>I was supposed to
    credit you 500,</i>

    106
    00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:53,380
    <i>Oh, I don't want you to
    get in trouble, but...</i>
    
    107
    00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,423
    <i>I could wire the amount back.</i>
    
    108
    00:08:57,424 --> 00:09:00,997
    <i>I will need a different
    password though.</i>
    
    109
    00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:02,457
    <i>One second.</i>
    
    110
    00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:06,078
    <i>This is the master password
    for all her accounts.</i>
    
    111
    00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,958
    <i>Okay, so the second we get
    it, we zero out everything.</i>
    
    112
    00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,961
    <i>Um...</i>
    
    113
    00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,400
    <i>You know, I, um...</i>
    
    114
    00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,448
    <i>I think I should
    call the bank. Hm?</i>
    
    115
    00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:23,187
    <i>You know what? You're
    probably right.</i>
    
    116
    00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,800
    <i>But there goes my job,</i>
    
    117
    00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:29,107
    <i>and there goes all your data.</i>

    <i>What did I do?</i>
    
    130
    00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,373
    <i>Stupid...</i>
    
    131
    00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,528
    <i>Mrs. Parker?</i>
    
    132
    00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:00,734
    <i>Don't move.</i>
    
    133
    00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,523
    <i>Don't you fucking move.</i>
    
    134
    00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:05,437
    <i>Drop the knife.</i>
    
    135
    00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,774
    <i>Hands behind your back.</i>
    
    136
    00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:17,449
    <i>Slowly get on your knees
    one knee at a time.</i>
    
    137
    00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,588
    <i>Now, who the fuck are you...</i>
    
    138
    00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,721
    <i>and what are you doing
    in my mother's house?</i>
    
    139
    00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,030
    <i>Verona...</i>
    
    140
    00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:36,133
    <i>I'm so sorry.</i>
    
    141
    00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:38,000
    <i>How do you know my...</i>
    
    142
    00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,519
    <i>Mom.</i>
    
    143
    00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,482
    <i>Until we can clear him,
    he's our best and only perp.</i>
    
    144
    00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:52,919
    <i>Clear him?</i>
    
    145
    00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,311
    <i>Agent Parker, I know
    that's your mother.</i>
    
    146
    00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:55,563
    <i>I understand.</i>
    
    147
    00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:58,985
    <i>But there's a world where
    she committed suicide.</i>
    
    148
    00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,888
    <i>Suicide? You can't be serious.</i>
    
    149
    00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:09,544
    <i>That woman loved life
    more than anybody I know.</i>
    
    150
    00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,764
    <i>But by all means, let's
    just completely ignore</i>
    
    151
    00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,809
    <i>the big white dude in
    her house with a knife.</i>
    
    152
    00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,219
    <i>Get him up.</i>
    
    153
    00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:16,638
    <i>Come on.</i>
    
    154
    00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,210
    <i>It's Clay, right?</i>
    
    155
    00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:23,906
    <i>Adam Clay?</i>
    
    156
    00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:25,875
    <i>I don't have much to say.</i>
    
    157
    00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,985
    <i>Mr. Clay, we just got
    a couple of questions.</i>
    
    158
    00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,390
    <i>Like, what the
    fuck were you doing</i>
    
    159
    00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,653
    <i>in my mother's house?</i>
    
    160
    00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,500
    <i>I was bringing her
    a jar of honey.</i>
    
    161
    00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:36,050
    <i>A jar of honey.</i>
    
    162
    00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:38,661
    <i>Who the fuck are
    you? Winnie-the-Pooh?</i>
    
    163
    00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,407
    <i>I keep bees.</i>
    
    164
    00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,492
    <i>How do you know my mother?</i>
    
    165
    00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,277
    <i>I rent some space in
    the barn from her.</i>
    
    166
    00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,453
    <i>I have a signed lease.</i>
    
    167
    00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:52,544
    <i>But what the fuck were
    you doing in her house?</i>
    
    168
    00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,504
    <i>She didn't answer
    when I knocked.</i>
    
    169
    00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:57,930
    <i>I noted her car in the driveway.</i>
    
    170
    00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,161
    <i>I heard the smoke
    alarm and I entered.</i>
    
    171
    00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,087
    <i>You "noted"?</i>
    
    172
    00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:04,125
    <i>You got a law
    enforcement background?</i>
    
    173
    00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,665
    <i>I told you, I take care of bees.</i>
    
    174
    00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,344
    <i>Oh, my God.</i>
    
    175
    00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:19,022
    <i>His hands tested negative
    for gunshot residue.</i>
    
    176
    00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:21,503
    <i>But the prints on the
    gun were your mother's.</i>
    
    177
    00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:24,724
    <i>It seems, sadly, it was suicide.</i>
    
    178
    00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:38,520
    <i>Mr. Clay, I need to
    apologize for last night.</i>
    
    179
    00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:42,089
    <i>I realize I may have
    been a little aggressive.</i>
    
    180
    00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,235
    <i>That's understandable.</i>
    
    181
    00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:53,243
    <i>Could I interest you in
    something a bit stronger?</i>
    
    182
    00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,625
    <i>No.</i>
    
    183
    00:15:58,105 --> 00:15:59,790
    <i>But I'll sit with
    you if you like.</i>
    
    184
    00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:07,809
    <i>No, thank you.</i>
    
    185
    00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:13,337
    <i>I wanted to thank you</i>
    
    186
    00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:16,407
    <i>for taking care of my mom.</i>
    
    187
    00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:20,834
    <i>I tried to stay in her
    life as much as I could.</i>
    
    188
    00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,499
    <i>Obviously, I could
    have done a better job.</i>
    
    189
    00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,177
    <i>Being old can be a lonely thing.</i>
    
    190
    00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:32,792
    <i>Turn a certain age, you cease
    to exist. Cease to matter.</i>
    
    191
    00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:36,230
    <i>Used to be a part of
    life, of the family.</i>
    
    192
    00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:39,209
    <i>Part of the hive, I
    guess you could say.</i>
    
    193
    00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,805
    <i>There's some British Isles
    hiding in your accent.</i>
    
    194
    00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:47,628
    <i>I was born there.</i>
    
    195
    00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,550
    <i>I hated that she
    was out here alone.</i>
    
    196
    00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,687
    <i>She wouldn't leave.</i>
    
    197
    00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,086
    <i>There's too many memories.</i>
    
    198
    00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:05,711
    <i>You know, I think I
    know why she liked you.</i>
    
    199
    00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:07,953
    <i>You're just like my brother.</i>
    
    200
    00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:11,508
    <i>He was in MARSOC,
    a Marine Raider.</i>
    
    201
    00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:14,743
    <i>He was killed a few
    years ago kicking doors.</i>
    
    202
    00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:18,930
    <i>She loved him.</i>
    
    203
    00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,906
    <i>He'd mow the lawn</i>
    
    204
    00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,579
    <i>and you'd think
    he invented fire.</i>
    
    205
    00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,366
    <i>You know, while I
    graduated the FBI Academy</i>
    
    206
    00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,543
    <i>and she said,
    "Oh, that's nice."</i>
    
    207
    00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,922
    <i>She got scammed.</i>
    
    208
    00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:36,971
    <i>Somebody emptied out
    all her accounts,</i>
    
    209
    00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:39,553
    <i>her savings, her retirement.</i>
    
    210
    00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:42,556
    <i>Got every penny. Maxed
    out all her cards.</i>
    
    211
    00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:44,471
    <i>She was an educator,</i>
    
    212
    00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:46,672
    <i>director of a charity for kids.</i>
    
    213
    00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:49,297
    <i>They got two million
    out of that account.</i>
    
    214
    00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,388
    <i>You know who did it?</i>
    
    215
    00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:55,438
    <i>I talked to an agent in
    our cyber-crimes office.</i>
    
    216
    00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:57,367
    <i>This crew's been
    operating for two years</i>
    
    217
    00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,086
    <i>and we don't even have names.</i>
    
    218
    00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,165
    <i>And even if we did, good
    luck building an indictment</i>
    
    219
    00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,563
    <i>that would stand up in court.</i>
    
    220
    00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:04,969
    <i>Some defense attorney
    would just argue that</i>
    
    221
    00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:07,477
    <i>the elderly victim agreed</i>
    
    222
    00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:09,542
    <i>to wire a complete stranger
    his entire life savings.</i>
    
    223
    00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,902
    <i>Taking from an elderly person</i>
    
    224
    00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:13,633
    <i>is as bad as stealing
    from a child.</i>
    
    225
    00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:16,717
    <i>Maybe worse.</i>
    
    226
    00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,718
    <i>Someone hurts a child,</i>
    
    227
    00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,117
    <i>there are parents.</i>
    
    228
    00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,850
    <i>People who care,
    ready to step in.</i>
    
    229
    00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:27,123
    <i>Someone hurts an older person...</i>
    
    230
    00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:31,823
    <i>sometimes they're left to
    face the hornets alone.</i>
    
    231
    00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:36,016
    <i>Because either it
    goes unnoticed...</i>
    
    232
    00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:39,788
    <i>or no one cares.</i>
    
    233
    00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:42,560
    <i>I care.</i>
    
    234
    00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:45,533
    <i>And I'm stubborn.</i>
    
    235
    00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:47,837
    <i>And so help me God,</i>
    
    236
    00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:50,494
    <i>I'm going to get these
    motherfuckers who did this.</i>
    
    237
    00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:58,241
    <i>I need to take care of the hive.</i>
    
    238
    00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,601
    <i>You've been up all night.</i>
    
    239
    00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,161
    <i>The hive is more important.</i>
    
    240
    00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:23,196
    <i>What are you doing?</i>
    
    241
    00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,180
    <i>- I thought you retired.
    - I did.</i>
    
    242
    00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,705
    <i>I need a favor.</i>
    
    243
    00:19:27,977 --> 00:19:29,403
    <i>What kind of favor?</i>
    
    244
    00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,995
    <i>A name and address.</i>
    
    245
    00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,899
    <i>- Easy.
    - Not easy.</i>
    
    246
    00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:38,495
    <i>Even the FBI can't
    find these people.</i>
    
    247
    00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,830
    <i>Well, we're not the FBI, are we?</i>
    
    248
    00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:42,596
    <i>Shoot me the deets and stand by.</i>
    
    249
    00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:50,180
    <i>Yeah.</i>
    
    250
    00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:52,271
    <i>You weren't kidding.
    This one kicked my butt.</i>
    
    251
    00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:53,861
    <i>They're routing
    all over the world.</i>
    
    252
    00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,210
    <i>But you found them?</i>
    
    253
    00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,352
    <i>Sure. But who
    are these people?</i>
    
    254
    00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,569
    <i>I'm gonna find out.</i>
    
    255
    00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:06,364
    <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>
    
    256

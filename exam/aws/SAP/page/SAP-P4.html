                                        You have deployed a web application targeting a global audience across multiple AWS Regions under the domain name.example.com. You decide to use<br/>Route53 Latency-Based Routing to serve web requests to users from the region closest to the user. To provide business continuity in the event of server downtime you configure weighted record sets associated with two web servers in separate Availability Zones per region. Dunning a DR test you notice that when you disable all web servers in one of the regions Route53 does not automatically direct all users to the other region.<br/>What could be happening? (Choose two.)<br/>

                                            How Health Checks Work in Complex Amazon Route 53 Configurations<br/>Checking the health of resources in complex configurations works much the same way as in simple configurations. However, in complex configurations, you use a combination of alias resource record sets (including weighted alias, latency alias, and failover alias) and nonalias resource record sets to build a decision tree that gives you greater control over how Amazon Route 53 responds to requests. For more information, see<br/>How Health Checks Work in Simple Amazon Route 53<br/><br/>Configurations -<br/>.<br/>For example, you might use latency alias resource record sets to select a region close to a user and use weighted resource record sets for two or more resources within each region to protect against the failure of a single endpoint or an Availability Zone. The following diagram shows this configuration.<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0002700001.png"/><br/>Here's how Amazon EC2 and Amazon Route 53 are configured:<br/>You have Amazon EC2 instances in two regions, us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2. You want Amazon Route 53 to respond to queries by using the resource record sets in the region that provides the lowest latency for your customers, so you create a latency alias resource record set for each region. (You create the latency alias resource record sets after you create resource record sets for the individual Amazon EC2 instances.)<br/>Within each region, you have two Amazon EC2 instances. You create a weighted resource record set for each instance. The name and the type are the same for both of the weighted resource record sets in each region.<br/>When you have multiple resources in a region, you can create weighted or failover resource record sets for your resources. You can also create even more complex configurations by creating weighted alias or failover alias resource record sets that, in turn, refer to multiple resources.<br/>Each weighted resource record set has an associated health check. The IP address for each health check matches the IP address for the corresponding resource record set. This isn't required, but it's the most common configuration.<br/>For both latency alias resource record sets, you set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes.<br/>You use the Evaluate Target Health setting for each latency alias resource record set to make Amazon Route 53 evaluate the health of the alias targetsג€"the weighted resource record setsג€"and respond accordingly.<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0002900001.png"/><br/>The preceding diagram illustrates the following sequence of events:<br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br/>Amazon Route 53 selects a weighted resource record set based on weight. Evaluate Target Health is Yes for the latency alias resource record set, so Amazon<br/>Route 53 checks the health of the selected weighted resource record set.<br/>The health check failed, so Amazon Route 53 chooses another weighted resource record set based on weight and checks its health. That resource record set also is unhealthy.<br/>Amazon Route 53 backs out of that branch of the tree, looks for the latency alias resource record set with the next-best latency, and chooses the resource record set for ap-southeast-2.<br/>Amazon Route 53 again selects a resource record set based on weight, and then checks the health of the selected resource record set. The health check passed, so Amazon Route 53 returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br/>What Happens When You Associate a Health Check with an Alias Resource Record Set?<br/>You can associate a health check with an alias resource record set instead of or in addition to setting the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes. However, it's generally more useful if Amazon Route 53 responds to queries based on the health of the underlying resourcesג€"the HTTP servers, database servers, and other resources that your alias resource record sets refer to. For example, suppose the following configuration:<br/>You assign a health check to a latency alias resource record set for which the alias target is a group of weighted resource record sets.<br/>You set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes for the latency alias resource record set.<br/>In this configuration, both of the following must be true before Amazon Route 53 will return the applicable value for a weighted resource record set:<br/>The health check associated with the latency alias resource record set must pass.<br/>At least one weighted resource record set must be considered healthy, either because it's associated with a health check that passes or because it's not associated with a health check. In the latter case, Amazon Route 53 always considers the weighted resource record set healthy.<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0003000001.png"/><br/>If the health check for the latency alias resource record set fails, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using any of the weighted resource record sets in the alias target, even if they're all healthy. Amazon Route 53 doesn't know the status of the weighted resource record sets because it never looks past the failed health check on the alias resource record set.<br/>What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?<br/>In a complex configuration, it's important to associate health checks with all of the non-alias resource record sets. Let's return to the preceding example, but assume that a health check is missing on one of the weighted resource record sets in the us-east-1 region:<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0003100001.png"/><br/>Here's what happens when you omit a health check on a non-alias resource record set in this configuration:<br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br/>Amazon Route 53 looks up the alias target for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the status of the corresponding health checks. The health check for one weighted resource record set failed, so that resource record set is omitted from consideration.<br/>The other weighted resource record set in the alias target for the us-east-1 region has no health check. The corresponding resource might or might not be healthy, but without a health check, Amazon Route 53 has no way to know. Amazon Route 53 assumes that the resource is healthy and returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br/>What Happens When You Set Evaluate Target Health to No?<br/>In general, you also want to set Evaluate Target Health to Yes for all of the alias resource record sets. In the following example, all of the weighted resource record sets have associated health checks, but Evaluate Target Health is set to No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region:<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0003200001.png"/><br/>Here's what happens when you set Evaluate Target Health to No for an alias resource record set in this configuration:<br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br/>Amazon Route 53 determines what the alias target is for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the corresponding health checks. They're both failing.<br/>Because the value of Evaluate Target Health is No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region, Amazon Route 53 must choose one resource record set in this branch instead of backing out of the branch and looking for a healthy resource record set in the ap-southeast-2 region.

                                            We can use either RDS or DynamoDB, however in our given answers, IAM role is mentioned only with RDS, so I would go with Answer B. Question was explicitly focused on security, so IAM with RDS is the best choice.

                                        You are tasked with moving a legacy application from a virtual machine running inside your datacenter to an Amazon VPC. Unfortunately, this app requires access to a number of on-premises services and no one who configured the app still works for your company. Even worse there's no documentation for it.<br/>What will allow the application running inside the VPC to reach back and access its internal dependencies without being reconfigured? (Choose three.)<br/>

                                            AWS Direct Connect -<br/>AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or collocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.<br/>AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an<br/><br/>Amazon -<br/>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)<br/>using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs.<br/>What is AWS Direct Connect?<br/>AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the<br/>AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and to Amazon Virtual Private<br/>Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to Amazon Web Services in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US).<br/>The following diagram shows how AWS Direct Connect interfaces with your network.<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0003600001.png"/><br/><br/>Requirements -<br/>To use AWS Direct Connect, your network must meet one of the following conditions:<br/>Your network is collocated with an existing AWS Direct Connect location. For more information on available AWS Direct Connect locations, go to http:// aws.amazon.com/directconnect/<br/>.<br/>You are working with an AWS Direct Connect partner who is a member of the AWS Partner Network (APN). For a list of AWS Direct Connect partners who can help you connect, go to http://aws.amazon.com/directconnect<br/>.<br/>You are working with an independent service provider to connect to AWS Direct Connect.<br/>In addition, your network must meet the following conditions:<br/>Connections to AWS Direct Connect require single mode fiber, 1000BASE-LX (1310nm) for 1 gigabit Ethernet, or 10GBASE-LR (1310nm) for 10 gigabit Ethernet.<br/>Auto Negotiation for the port must be disabled. You must support 802.1Q VLANs across these connections.<br/>Your network must support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and BGP MD5 authentication. Optionally, you may configure Bidirectional Forwarding Detection<br/>(BFD).<br/>To connect to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you must first do the following:<br/>Provide a private Autonomous System Number (ASN). Amazon allocates a private IP address in the 169.x.x.x range to you.<br/>Create a virtual private gateway and attach it to your VPC. For more information about creating a virtual private gateway, see<br/>Adding a Hardware Virtual Private<br/><br/>Gateway to Your VPC -<br/>in the Amazon VPC User Guide.<br/>To connect to public AWS products such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3, you need to provide the following:<br/>A public ASN that you own (preferred) or a private ASN.<br/>Public IP addresses (/31) (that is, one for each end of the BGP session) for each BGP session. If you do not have public IP addresses to assign to this connection, log on to AWS and then open a ticket with AWS Support<br/>.<br/>The public routes that you will advertise over BGP.

                                            Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.<br/>Amazon EBS provides three volume types: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic. The three volume types differ in performance characteristics and cost, so you can choose the right storage performance and price for the needs of your applications. All EBS volume types offer the same durable snapshot capabilities and are designed for 99.999% availability.

                                        A large real-estate brokerage is exploring the option of adding a cost-effective location based alert to their existing mobile application. The application backend infrastructure currently runs on AWS. Users who opt in to this service will receive alerts on their mobile device regarding real-estate otters in proximity to their location. For the alerts to be relevant delivery time needs to be in the low minute count the existing mobile app has 5 million users across the US.<br/>Which one of the following architectural suggestions would you make to the customer?<br/>

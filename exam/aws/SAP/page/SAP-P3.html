                                        You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached. The EC2 instance is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS. The four EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID 0 device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4,000<br/>IOPS (4,000 16KB reads or writes), for a total of 16,000 random IOPS on the instance. The EC2 instance initially delivers the expected 16,000 IOPS random read and write performance. Sometime later, in order to increase the total random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned<br/>IOPS volumes to the RAID. Each volume is provisioned to 4,000 IOPs like the original four, for a total of 24,000 IOPS on the EC2 instance. Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%, but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all.<br/>What is the problem and a valid solution?<br/>

                                        Your company is storing millions of sensitive transactions across thousands of 100-GB files that must be encrypted in transit and at rest. Analysts concurrently depend on subsets of files, which can consume up to 5 TB of space, to generate simulations that can be used to steer business decisions.<br/>You are required to design an AWS solution that can cost effectively accommodate the long-term storage and in-flight subsets of data.<br/>Which approach can satisfy these objectives?<br/>

                                        Your customer is willing to consolidate their log streams (access logs, application logs, security logs, etc.) in one single system. Once consolidated, the customer wants to analyze these logs in real time based on heuristics. From time to time, the customer needs to validate heuristics, which requires going back to data samples extracted from the last 12 hours.<br/>What is the best approach to meet your customerג€™s requirements?<br/>

                                            The throughput of an Amazon Kinesis stream is designed to scale without limits via increasing the number of shards within a stream. However, there are certain limits you should keep in mind while using Amazon Kinesis Streams:<br/>By default,<br/>of a stream are accessible for up to 24 hours from the time they are added to the stream. You can raise this limit to up to 7 days by enabling extended data retention.<br/><br/>The maximum size of a -<br/>data blob<br/>(the data payload before Base64-encoding) within one record is 1 megabyte (MB).<br/><br/>Each -<br/>shard<br/>can support up to 1000 PUT records per second.<br/>For more information about other API level limits, see<br/><br/>Amazon Kinesis Streams Limits -<br/>.

                                            There is no such thing as "Most appropriate" without knowing all your goals. I find your scenarios very fuzzy, since you can obviously mix-n-match between them. I think you should decide by layers instead:<br/>Load Balancer Layer: ELB or just DNS, or roll-your-own. (Using DNS+EIPs is slightly cheaper, but less reliable than ELB.)<br/>Storage Layer for 17TB of Images: This is the perfect use case for S3. Off-load all the web requests directly to the relevant JPEGs in S3. Your EC2 boxes just generate links to them.<br/>If your app already serves it's own images (not links to images), you might start with EFS. But more than likely, you can just setup a web server to re-write or re- direct all JPEG links to S3 pretty easily.<br/>If you use S3, don't serve directly from the bucket - Serve via a CNAME in domain you control. That way, you can switch in CloudFront easily.<br/>EBS will be way more expensive, and you'll need 2x the drives if you need 2 boxes. Yuck.<br/>Consider a smaller storage format. For example, JPEG200 or WebP or other tools might make for smaller images. There is also the DejaVu format from a while back.<br/>Cache Layer: Adding CloudFront in front of S3 will help people on the other side of the world -- well, possibly. Typical archives follow a power law. The long tail of requests means that most JPEGs won't be requested enough to be in the cache. So you are only speeding up the most popular objects. You can always wait, and switch in CF later after you know your costs better. (In some cases, it can actually lower costs.)<br/>You can also put CloudFront in front of your app, since your archive search results should be fairly static. This will also allow you to run with a smaller instance type, since CF will handle much of the load if you do it right.<br/>Database Layer: A few options:<br/>Use whatever your current server does for now, and replace with something else down the road. Don't under-estimate this approach, sometimes it's better to start now and optimize later.<br/><br/>Use RDS to run MySQL/Postgres -<br/>I'm not as familiar with ElasticSearch / Cloudsearch, but obviously Cloudsearch will be less maintenance+setup.<br/>App Layer:<br/>When creating the app layer from scratch, consider CloudFormation and/or OpsWorks. It's extra stuff to learn, but helps down the road.<br/>Java+Tomcat is right up the alley of ElasticBeanstalk. (Basically EC2 + Autoscale + ELB).<br/>Preventing Abuse: When you put something in a public S3 bucket, people will hot-link it from their web pages. If you want to prevent that, your app on the EC2 box can generate signed links to S3 that expire in a few hours. Now everyone will be forced to go thru the app, and the app can apply rate limiting, etc.<br/>Saving money: If you don't mind having downtime:<br/>run everything in one AZ (both DBs and EC2s). You can always add servers and AZs down the road, as long as it's architected to be stateless. In fact, you should use multiple regions if you want it to be really robust. use Reduced Redundancy in S3 to save a few hundred bucks per month (Someone will have to "go fix it" every time it breaks, including having an off-line copy to repair S3.)<br/>Buy Reserved Instances on your EC2 boxes to make them cheaper. (Start with the RI market and buy a partially used one to get started.) It's just a coupon saying<br/>"if you run this type of box in this AZ, you will save on the per-hour costs." You can get 1/2 to 1/3 off easily.<br/>Rewrite the application to use less memory and CPU - that way you can run on fewer/smaller boxes. (May or may not be worth the investment.)<br/>If your app will be used very infrequently, you will save a lot of money by using Lambda. I'd be worried that it would be quite slow if you tried to run a Java application on it though.<br/>We're missing some information like load, latency expectations from search, indexing speed, size of the search index, etc. But with what you've given us, I would go with S3 as the storage for the files (S3 rocks. It is really, really awesome). If you're stuck with the commercial search application, then on EC2 instances with autoscaling and an ELB. If you are allowed an alternative search engine, Elasticsearch is probably your best bet. I'd run it on EC2 instead of the AWS<br/>Elasticsearch service, as IMHO it's not ready yet. Don't autoscale Elasticsearch automatically though, it'll cause all sorts of issues. I have zero experience with<br/>CloudSearch so ic an't comment on that. Regardless of which option, I'd use CloudFormation for all of it.

                                            Bucket Owner Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own<br/>In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own.<br/>Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues:<br/>The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS account that created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate those permissions.<br/>Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported.<br/>In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket.<br/>Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using IAM Roles<br/>IAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an IAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each IAM role you create has two policies attached to it:<br/>A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role.<br/>An access policy defining what permissionsג€"for example, s3:GetObjectג€"are allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see<br/>Specifying Permissions in a Policy<br/>.<br/>The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects:<br/>Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials.<br/>Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket.<br/>For more information about IAM roles, go to<br/>Roles (Delegation and Federation)<br/>in IAM User Guide.<br/>The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps:<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0002400001.png"/><br/>Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects.<br/>Account A administrator creates an IAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A.<br/>Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full-control permission to the bucket owner.<br/>Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows the user to assume the role.<br/>User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials. Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket.<br/>For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per IAM guidelines (see<br/>About Using an Administrator User to Create Resources and Grant Permissions<br/>) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough.<br/>Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and use those credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0002500001.png"/>

                                            Volume gateway provides an iSCSI target, which enables you to create volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers.<br/>The volume gateway runs in either a cached or stored mode.<br/>In the cached mode, your primary data is written to S3, while you retain some portion of it locally in a cache for frequently accessed data.<br/>In the stored mode, your primary data is stored locally and your entire dataset is available for low-latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS.<br/>In either mode, you can take point-in-time snapshots of your volumes and store them in Amazon S3, enabling you to make space-efficient versioned copies of your volumes for data protection and various data reuse needs.

                                        To serve Web traffic for a popular product your chief financial officer and IT director have purchased 10 m1.large heavy utilization Reserved Instances (RIs), evenly spread across two availability zones; Route 53 is used to deliver the traffic to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). After several months, the product grows even more popular and you need additional capacity. As a result, your company purchases two C3.2xlarge medium utilization Ris. You register the two c3.2xlarge instances with your ELB and quickly find that the m1.large instances are at 100% of capacity and the c3.2xlarge instances have significant capacity that's unused.<br/>Which option is the most cost effective and uses EC2 capacity most effectively?<br/>

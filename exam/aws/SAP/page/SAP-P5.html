<span class="answer-description">
                                            Using Reduced Redundancy Storage Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class. It assigns the storage class to an object when it is written to<br/>Amazon S3. You can assign objects a specific storage class (standard or reduced redundancy) only when you write the objects to an Amazon S3 bucket or when you copy objects that are already stored in Amazon S3. Standard is the default storage class. For information about storage classes, see<br/><br/>Object Key and -<br/><br/>Metadata -<br/>.<br/>In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3 provides with standard storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage solution. For example, it can be a cost-effective solution for sharing media content that is durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image.<br/>Reduced redundancy storage is designed to provide 99.99% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. For example, if you store 10,000 objects using the RRS option, you can, on average, expect to incur an annual loss of a single object per year (0.01% of 10,000 objects).<br/>Note:<br/>This annual loss represents an expected average and does not guarantee the loss of less than 0.01% of objects in a given year.<br/>Reduced redundancy storage stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but it does not replicate objects as many times as Amazon S3 standard storage. In addition, reduced redundancy storage is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.<br/>If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon S3 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object. Amazon S3 also offers notifications for reduced redundancy storage object loss: you can configure your bucket so that when Amazon S3 detects the loss of an RRS object, a notification will be sent through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You can then replace the lost object. To enable notifications, you can use the Amazon S3 console to set the Notifications property of your bucket.<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0004200001.png"/>

                                            Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments -<br/>Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.<br/><br/>Enhanced Durability -<br/><br/>Multi-AZ deployments for the -<br/>,<br/><br/>Oracle -<br/>, and<br/><br/>PostgreSQL -<br/>engines utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the<br/><br/>SQL Server -<br/>engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone.<br/>If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a<br/>Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.<br/><br/>Amazon Aurora -<br/>employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.<br/><br/>Increased Availability -<br/>You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines (see the<br/><br/>RDS FAQ -<br/>for details).<br/>The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB<br/>Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete.<br/>Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby. However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-<br/>AZ deployments.<br/>On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.

                                            Point-In-Time Recovery -<br/>In addition to the daily automated backup, Amazon RDS archives database change logs. This enables you to recover your database to any point in time during the backup retention period, up to the last five minutes of database usage.<br/>Amazon RDS stores multiple copies of your data, but for Single-AZ DB instances these copies are stored in a single availability zone. If for any reason a Single-AZ<br/>DB instance becomes unusable, you can use point-in-time recovery to launch a new DB instance with the latest restorable data. For more information on working with point-in-time recovery, go to<br/>Restoring a DB Instance to a Specified Time<br/>.<br/><br/>Note -<br/>Multi-AZ deployments store copies of your data in different Availability Zones for greater levels of data durability.

                                            As per the document defined, new IPs should be reserved not the same ones<br/>Elastic IP Addresses are static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses enable you to mask instance or Availability Zone failures by programmatically remapping your public IP addresses to instances in your account in a particular region. For<br/>DR, you can also pre-allocate some IP addresses for the most critical systems so that their IP addresses are already known before disaster strikes. This can simplify the execution of the DR plan.<br/>Reference:<br/>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/resources.html

You have experienced several infrastructure failures in the past two months resulting in significant financial losses. Your CIO is strongly agreeing to move the application to AWS. While working on achieving buy-in from the other company executives, he asks you to develop a disaster recovery plan to help improve Business continuity in the short term. He specifies a target Recovery Time<br/>Objective (RTO) of 4 hours and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 hour or less. He also asks you to implement the solution within 2 weeks.<br/>Your database is 200GB in size and you have a 20Mbps Internet connection. How would you do this while minimizing costs?<br/>

                                            Overview of Creating Amazon EBS-Backed AMIs<br/>First, launch an instance from an AMI that's similar to the AMI that you'd like to create. You can connect to your instance and customize it. When the instance is configured correctly, ensure data integrity by stopping the instance before you create an AMI, then create the image. When you create an Amazon EBS-backed<br/>AMI, we automatically register it for you.<br/>Amazon EC2 powers down the instance before creating the AMI to ensure that everything on the instance is stopped and in a consistent state during the creation process. If you're confident that your instance is in a consistent state appropriate for AMI creation, you can tell Amazon EC2 not to power down and reboot the instance. Some file systems, such as XFS, can freeze and unfreeze activity, making it safe to create the image without rebooting the instance.<br/>During the AMI-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance's root volume and any other EBS volumes attached to your instance. If any volumes attached to the instance are encrypted, the new AMI only launches successfully on instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see<br/><br/>Amazon EBS Encryption -<br/>.<br/>Depending on the size of the volumes, it can take several minutes for the AMI-creation process to complete (sometimes up to 24 hours). You may find it more efficient to create snapshots of your volumes prior to creating your AMI. This way, only small, incremental snapshots need to be created when the AMI is created, and the process completes more quickly (the total time for snapshot creation remains the same). For more information, see<br/><br/>Creating an Amazon EBS Snapshot -<br/>.<br/>After the process completes, you have a new AMI and snapshot created from the root volume of the instance. When you launch an instance using the new AMI, we create a new EBS volume for its root volume using the snapshot. Both the AMI and the snapshot incur charges to your account until you delete them. For more information, see<br/><br/>Deregistering Your AMI -<br/>.<br/>If you add instance-store volumes or EBS volumes to your instance in addition to the root device volume, the block device mapping for the new AMI contains information for these volumes, and the block device mappings for instances that you launch from the new AMI automatically contain information for these volumes.<br/>The instance-store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the new instance are new and don't contain any data from the instance store volumes of the instance you used to create the AMI. The data on EBS volumes persists. For more information, see<br/><br/>Block Device Mapping -<br/>.

                                            Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own<br/>In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own.<br/>Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues:<br/>The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS account that created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate those permissions.<br/>Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported.<br/>In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket.<br/>Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using IAM Roles<br/>IAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an IAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each IAM role you create has two policies attached to it:<br/>A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role.<br/>An access policy defining what permissionsג€"for example, s3:GetObjectג€"are allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see<br/>Specifying Permissions in a Policy<br/>.<br/>The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects:<br/>Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials.<br/>Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket.<br/>For more information about IAM roles, go to<br/>Roles (Delegation and Federation)<br/>in IAM User Guide.<br/>The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps:<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0005000001.png"/><br/>Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects.<br/>Account A administrator creates an IAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A.<br/>Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full-control permission to the bucket owner.<br/>Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows the user to assume the role.<br/>User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials. Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket.<br/>For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per IAM guidelines (see<br/>About Using an Administrator User to Create Resources and Grant Permissions<br/>) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough.<br/>Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and use those credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions<br/><img class="in-exam-image" src="/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0005100001.png"/>

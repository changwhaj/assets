                                            There is no such thing as "Most appropriate" without knowing all your goals. I find your scenarios very fuzzy, since you can obviously mix-n-match between them. I think you should decide by layers instead:<br/>Load Balancer Layer: ELB or just DNS, or roll-your-own. (Using DNS+EIPs is slightly cheaper, but less reliable than ELB.)<br/>Storage Layer for 17TB of Images: This is the perfect use case for S3. Off-load all the web requests directly to the relevant JPEGs in S3. Your EC2 boxes just generate links to them.<br/>If your app already serves it's own images (not links to images), you might start with EFS. But more than likely, you can just setup a web server to re-write or re- direct all JPEG links to S3 pretty easily.<br/>If you use S3, don't serve directly from the bucket - Serve via a CNAME in domain you control. That way, you can switch in CloudFront easily.<br/>EBS will be way more expensive, and you'll need 2x the drives if you need 2 boxes. Yuck.<br/>Consider a smaller storage format. For example, JPEG200 or WebP or other tools might make for smaller images. There is also the DejaVu format from a while back.<br/>Cache Layer: Adding CloudFront in front of S3 will help people on the other side of the world -- well, possibly. Typical archives follow a power law. The long tail of requests means that most JPEGs won't be requested enough to be in the cache. So you are only speeding up the most popular objects. You can always wait, and switch in CF later after you know your costs better. (In some cases, it can actually lower costs.)<br/>You can also put CloudFront in front of your app, since your archive search results should be fairly static. This will also allow you to run with a smaller instance type, since CF will handle much of the load if you do it right.<br/>Database Layer: A few options:<br/>Use whatever your current server does for now, and replace with something else down the road. Don't under-estimate this approach, sometimes it's better to start now and optimize later.<br/><br/>Use RDS to run MySQL/Postgres -<br/>I'm not as familiar with ElasticSearch / Cloudsearch, but obviously Cloudsearch will be less maintenance+setup.<br/>App Layer:<br/>When creating the app layer from scratch, consider CloudFormation and/or OpsWorks. It's extra stuff to learn, but helps down the road.<br/>Java+Tomcat is right up the alley of ElasticBeanstalk. (Basically EC2 + Autoscale + ELB).<br/>Preventing Abuse: When you put something in a public S3 bucket, people will hot-link it from their web pages. If you want to prevent that, your app on the EC2 box can generate signed links to S3 that expire in a few hours. Now everyone will be forced to go thru the app, and the app can apply rate limiting, etc.<br/>Saving money: If you don't mind having downtime:<br/>run everything in one AZ (both DBs and EC2s). You can always add servers and AZs down the road, as long as it's architected to be stateless. In fact, you should use multiple regions if you want it to be really robust. use Reduced Redundancy in S3 to save a few hundred bucks per month (Someone will have to "go fix it" every time it breaks, including having an off-line copy to repair S3.)<br/>Buy Reserved Instances on your EC2 boxes to make them cheaper. (Start with the RI market and buy a partially used one to get started.) It's just a coupon saying<br/>"if you run this type of box in this AZ, you will save on the per-hour costs." You can get 1/2 to 1/3 off easily.<br/>Rewrite the application to use less memory and CPU - that way you can run on fewer/smaller boxes. (May or may not be worth the investment.)<br/>If your app will be used very infrequently, you will save a lot of money by using Lambda. I'd be worried that it would be quite slow if you tried to run a Java application on it though.<br/>We're missing some information like load, latency expectations from search, indexing speed, size of the search index, etc. But with what you've given us, I would go with S3 as the storage for the files (S3 rocks. It is really, really awesome). If you're stuck with the commercial search application, then on EC2 instances with autoscaling and an ELB. If you are allowed an alternative search engine, Elasticsearch is probably your best bet. I'd run it on EC2 instead of the AWS<br/>Elasticsearch service, as IMHO it's not ready yet. Don't autoscale Elasticsearch automatically though, it'll cause all sorts of issues. I have zero experience with<br/>CloudSearch so ic an't comment on that. Regardless of which option, I'd use CloudFormation for all of it.

                                            On Amazon EC2, a web startup hosts its very successful social news service using an Elastic Load Balancer, an Auto-Scaling group of Java/Tomcat application servers, and DynamoDB as the data store. The primary web application performs optimally on m2 x big instances because to its high memory requirements. Each new deployment necessitates the semi-automated building and testing of a new AMI for the application servers, which takes a considerable amount of time and is consequently only performed once per week.<br/>Recently, a new chat functionality was introduced into the architecture using nodejs and wails. The first testing indicate that the new component is CPU-bound. Due to the company's prior experience with Chef, they chose to streamline the deployment process by using AWS Ops Works as an application life cycle management platform to simplify application administration and minimize deployment cycles.<br/><br/>What AWS Ops Works setup is required to incorporate the new chat module in the most cost-effective and flexible manner possible?

                                            A financial institution is running its mission-critical application on Amazon Web Services' current-generation Linux EC2 instances. The program features a self-managed MySQL database that handles a large amount of I/O. The application is doing well in terms of handling a reasonable quantity of traffic throughout the month. However, it slows down significantly during the last three days of each month owing to month-end reporting, despite the fact that the firm uses Elastic Load Balancers and Auto Scaling to meet increasing demand.<br/><br/>Which of the following actions would enable the database to manage the month-end load with the LEAST amount of performance degradation?

                                            A significant mobile gaming firm just completed a successful migration of its on-premises infrastructure to the AWS Cloud. A solutions architect is doing an assessment of the environment to confirm that it was constructed in accordance with the design and is operating in accordance with the Well-Architected Framework.<br/><br/>While analyzing prior monthly charges in Cost Explorer, the solutions architect finds that the creation and subsequent termination of various big instance types use a disproportionate amount of resources. The solutions architect discovers that the company's developers are creating new Amazon EC2 instances for testing purposes and are not utilizing the correct instance types.<br/><br/>The solutions architect must design a method that restricts the instance kinds that may be launched by only developers.<br/><br/>Which solution will satisfy these criteria?

                                            If you need to host multiple websites (with different IPs) on a single EC2 instance, the following is the suggested method from AWS.<br/>Launch a VPC instance with two network interfaces.<br/>Assign elastic IPs from VPC EIP pool to those interfaces (Because, when the user has attached more than one network interface with an instance, AWS cannot assign public IPs to them.) Assign separate Security Groups if separate Security Groups are needed This scenario also helps for operating network appliances, such as firewalls or load balancers that have multiple private IP addresses for each network interface.<br/>Reference:<br/>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html

                                            A business operates its AWS infrastructure in two AWS Regions. The firm operates four virtual private clouds in the eu-west-1 region and two in the us-east-1 region. Additionally, the firm has an on-premises data center in Europe, which is connected to AWS through two AWS Direct Connect connections in eu-west-1.<br/>The organization requires a solution that enables Amazon EC2 instances inside each VPC to communicate with one another using private IP addresses. Additionally, servers in the on-premises data center must be able to access those VPCs through private IP addresses.<br/><br/>Which approach is the MOST cost-effective in terms of meeting these requirements?

                                            Generally, AWS EC2 allows running 20 on-demand instances and 100 spot instances at a time. This limit can be increased by requesting at https:// aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request.<br/>Excluding certain types of instances, the limit is lower than mentioned above. For cg1.4xlarge, the user can run only 2 on-demand instances at a time.<br/>Reference:<br/>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_ec2

                                            The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web<br/>Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. If the organization wants the Amazon EC2 instances to have a private IP address, he should create a public and private subnet for VPC in each Availability Zone (this is an AWS Elastic Beanstalk requirement). The organization should add their public resources, such as ELB and NAT to the public subnet, and AWC Elastic Beanstalk will assign them unique elastic IP addresses (a static, public IP address). The organization should launch Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet so that AWS Elastic Beanstalk assigns them non-routable private IP addresses. Now the organization should configure route tables with the following rules:<br/>✑ route all inbound traffic from ELB to EC2 instances<br/>✑ route all outbound traffic from EC2 instances through NAT<br/>Reference:<br/>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo-vpc.html
